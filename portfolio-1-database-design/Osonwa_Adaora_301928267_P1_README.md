# Portfolio 1 — Database Design and Modelling

I organised the data into patients, clinicians, appointments. The design document explains the fields, keys, relationships and business rules. The normalisation document shows the sample tables at 1NF, 2NF and 3NF.

## Database checks

| Table | Rows |
| --- | --- |
| patients | 2 |
| clinicians | 2 |
| appointments | 2 |

The 21 invalid inserts were rejected at their expected constraints, and the valid sample rows remained unchanged.

## Run the SQL

Create a fresh PostgreSQL database. Run the schema first, then the sample data. Run the deliberately invalid statements in ConstraintTests.sql individually outside a transaction; each is expected to produce an error.
